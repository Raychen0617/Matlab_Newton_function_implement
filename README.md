# Matlab_Newton_function_implement

```
Given P(𝑥) = 𝑥
4 − 11.0 𝑥
3 + 42.35 𝑥
2 − 66.55 𝑥 + 35.1384,
```
## solve all zeros of P(x)=0 by using<br>
1. the solver available in Matlab,<br>
2. Your own Matlab program based on Newton’s method,and then compare the results.<br>
## Note:<br>
1. Do this by deflating the polynomial after getting a root and then getting the next<br>
from the deflated polynomial.<br>
2. Before getting a root, use Matlab to plot the curve and see where are the roots.<br>
